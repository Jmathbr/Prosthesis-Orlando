# Prosthesis-Orlando

* Context:

The patient lost part of his forearm, leaving a stump about six inches off his elbow.<br>

* Summary:

The modular prosthesis aims to make the patient perform activities not possible without the arm, such as using a knife, playing the guitar and even writing.<br>

The project was all modeled on patient independence, so after 3d parts and assembly, it is expected that the patient can change the modules alone and that this is not a complicated task.<br>

The modules can be allocated to the prothesis in **10 positions** (36 degrees per position), so the patient can remove the module and reposition to make it better.<br>

## Modules:

### Module Angle Joint (:triangular_ruler:):

The purpose of this module is to create one more rotation axis with **22 new positions** (approximately 16 degrees per position).<br>
The angle joining module should be used in conjunction with another module.<br>
