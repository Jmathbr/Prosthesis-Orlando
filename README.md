# Prosthesis-Orlando

* Context:

The patient lost part of his forearm, leaving a stump about six inches off his elbow.<br>

* Summary:

The modular prothesis has the purpose of getting the patient to return to previous activity, such as using a knife, playing the guitar, and even writing.<br>

The project was all modeled on patient independence, so after 3d parts and assembly, it is expected that the patient can change the modules alone and that this is not a complicated task.<br>
